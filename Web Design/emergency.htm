           The TMC emergency department takes pride in their reputation for performing emergency techniques that increase the viability of patient recovery.
           Using state of the art procedures and equipment, patients no longer have to sit and wait to see a physician.  All patients are seen by an ER doctor within 15 minutes or less of their arrial.  Critical patients are seen immediately.
